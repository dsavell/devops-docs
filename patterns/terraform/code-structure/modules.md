# Modules

## Repository Name

Note: Git repository naming conventions should adhrere to the pattern defined here:&#x20;

1. All repository names must be prefixed with `terraform-`
2. Inflix must be related to the cloud provider `azurerm-`
3. Suffix must have a descriptive name or meaning to what the module is doing. `network`

* Good: `terraform-azurerm-firewall`
* Bad: `tf-myorg-module`
