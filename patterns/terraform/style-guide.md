# Style Guide

### &#x20;Code Format

Must adhere to Terraforms own style convention using `terraform fmt` more on this here: [https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/syntax/style](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/syntax/style)

### General Conventions

* use `_` (underscores) instead of `-` (dashes) everywhere in resource names, data source names, variable names & outputs.
* Use lower case and numbers.
