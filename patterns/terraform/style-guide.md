# Style Guide

### &#x20;Code Format

### General Conventions

* Use `_` (underscores) instead of `-` (dashes) everywhere in resource names, data source names, variable names & outputs.
* Use lower case & numbers where possible.
* File names must use `-` (dash) in the name.
* Folder names must use `_` (underscore) in the name.
